the original repo is from https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch  
So what i am doing is to add some comment to make me understand how it works.  
The details is in chinese and you can see in demotest.py file  
This repo is 100% same as the original one. I push this on my github is only for reference
